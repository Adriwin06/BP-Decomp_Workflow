# Agent Operating Guide

Entry point for **any** agent working in this repo — Claude Code, Codex,
Antigravity, or a future API/LiteLLM loop. This file is intentionally tool-
agnostic. Coordination happens through files and a small CLI, never through any
one tool's private memory.

## Resuming ("continue")

If told only to "continue", do this: if `progress/ledger.sqlite` is missing (fresh
clone), run `work bootstrap` once — it inits submodules and rebuilds the ledger from
the committed `progress/status.json` + `progress/tu_deps.json`, restoring exactly
where the last commit left off. Then `work next` → pick up the next TU. No other
context is needed.

## Read first, in order

1. [`README.md`](README.md) — what this repo is (orchestration, not the decomp).
2. [`STRATEGY.md`](STRATEGY.md) — the plan, the build roles, the identity model,
   the stub scaffold, and what "done" means. **Do not start work without it.**
3. The ledger under [`progress/`](progress/) — current state of every TU/function.

## What you are doing

Reconstructing the **X360 build** as compilable **PC C++**, one translation unit
at a time, landing recovered code in [`b5-decomp/src`](b5-decomp/src/). Target is
**semantic parity, not byte-matching**. A unit is done when: reconstructed → the
TU compiles → a reviewer pass approves.

## The work loop

```
work next             # claim the next dependency-ready translation unit
work show <tu>        # concise overview (functions, signatures, dependency TUs)
work show <tu> --full # the full dossier: pseudocode, locals, Feb-2007 original
                      #   source, callee signatures (--asm for disasm, -o to a file)
work start <tu>       # claim it (todo -> in_progress)
work stubs <tu>       # trap-stub the callees this TU needs that aren't done yet
                      #   (leaf-first usually means few/none; --list to preview)
  …reconstruct the C++ into b5-decomp/src/<mirrored path>…
work submit <tu>      # run the compile gate; on pass, emit a reviewer packet
  …review per policy (see Verification) — tiered, may be skipped or delegated…
work review <tu> --verdict pass|fail [--notes "…"]   # record the verdict
work block <tu> "…"   # mark blocked + reason so it is not reclaimed
```

**Batching.** Reconstruct one TU per pass by default. If the user names a count
("do 5"), claim that many dependency-ready TUs, reconstruct them in one pass, submit
each, then do a single combined review pass over the batch — it amortizes fixed cost.
The default count lives in `progress/review.config.json` (`batch.default_tus_per_pass`).

## Verification (what `submit` / `review` expect)

1. **Compile gate.** `work submit` compiles the TU's `.cpp` (`cl /c`, no link) against
   current headers. On **fail** it prints the diagnostics and returns the TU to
   `in_progress` — fix and re-submit. On **pass** the TU goes `compiled` and a reviewer
   packet is written to `progress/reviews/<tu>.md`. (If MSVC isn't configured the gate
   reports `skip` and still proceeds — see `progress/verify.config.json`. The EA
   submodules must be checked out — `git -C b5-decomp submodule update --init` — for
   anything that includes EASTL/EABase to compile.)
2. **Reviewer pass — YOU choose, per `progress/review.config.json`.** Not every TU
   needs a separate full review; an always-on Opus review per TU is the main quota sink.
   The config is a **menu + policy, not an auto-router**: you (the reverser agent) read
   it and decide, per TU, whether to review and with what. After a clean compile gate:
   - **Classify** the TU as `trivial | standard | complex` (`review.classify_hints`).
   - If `review.enabled` is false, or the class is `trivial` (per `selection_guidance`):
     **skip** the pass — the compile gate + your own self-check is the gate. Record it
     yourself: `work review … --verdict pass --notes "trivial; gate-only"`.
   - Otherwise **choose** a provider+model from `providers` (only those with `have:true`)
     and a thinking level inside that model's allowed range, following `selection_guidance`
     (cheapest capable for `standard`; stronger + more thinking for `complex`; bump a notch
     via `escalate_when_unsure` when you doubt your own work — FP precision, signedness,
     guessed offsets, inferred data tables). **You make the call**; deviate with a noted
     reason when a TU warrants it.
   - **Invoke your choice yourself:**
     - Run the chosen provider's (`claude-code`, `codex`, or `antigravity`) `command` template
       via your shell/Bash tool (substitute `{model}`, `{thinking_flag}`, and `{prompt}`).
       - Note: If the model has `"thinking": false`, substitute `{thinking_flag}` with an empty string `""`.
         Otherwise, substitute `{thinking_flag}` using the provider's `thinking_flag` template (replacing `{thinking}` with the chosen level).
       Feed the review packet's contents or path as `{prompt}`. Capture its `VERDICT`.
   - The reviewer compares the produced C++ against the dossier and returns
     `VERDICT: pass|fail` + findings. Record it with `work review`. A pass marks the TU
     `done`; a fail returns it to `in_progress` with the notes.
   If the config is missing, default to: review every non-trivial TU with the cheapest
   Claude model you can spawn.

The `work` CLI ([`tools/work/work.py`](tools/work/work.py), via the repo-root
`work.cmd` shim) is the only interface you must learn. It is identical for every
agent. If the ledger is missing, build it once with `work seed --deps` (it is
rebuilt from the committed `progress/identity.json` + `progress/tu_index.json`).

## Conventions

- **Identity is the normalized qualified name** (`Namespace::Class::method`), not an
  address. See STRATEGY.md. Never assume an address means the same thing in two
  builds.
- **Reconstruct from the X360 spine.** Use PS3/DecFIGS for a second opinion and file
  attribution. Use Feb-2007 real source when the TU overlaps it.
- **BPR/TUB are reference-only**, consulted per-function for *platform* layers
  (SIMD, GPU/D3D, codecs) where the PC shape differs from the console. They are not
  in the ledger; do not "decompile" them.
- **Stubs over guesses.** A call to a not-yet-reconstructed function gets a forward
  declaration + trap stub (`work stubs <tu>`), not an invented body. Because we work
  leaf-first, most callees are already real by the time you reach a caller, so stubs
  are the exception. A generated stub for a class method only compiles once that
  class is declared — declaring it is the type-recovery part you still do.
- **Types live in headers** and are shared global state. Extend them; let the
  compile gate surface conflicts. Don't redefine a type locally to dodge an error.
- **Update the ledger, not your own memory.** Progress that isn't in `progress/` did
  not happen as far as the next agent is concerned.
- **Mirror original paths.** A function whose `primary_file` is
  `GameSource/Replays/Foo.cpp` lands at `b5-decomp/src/GameSource/Replays/Foo.cpp`.

## Don't

- Don't run global structural matching (Diaphora) as a prerequisite. Names join the
  symbolized builds; structural matching is an optional per-function last resort.
- Don't chase a whole-program link early. Per-TU compilation is the gate.
- Don't invent function bodies to make something compile — stub and move on.

## Tool-specific notes

- **Claude Code** reads `CLAUDE.md`, which points here. This file is canonical.
- **Codex / Antigravity** read `AGENTS.md` (this file) directly.
- Keep anything an agent must obey in this file or `STRATEGY.md`, so every tool
  inherits it.
